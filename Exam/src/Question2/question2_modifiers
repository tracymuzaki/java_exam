Modifiers are used when declaring attributes to grant access to them.
A private modifier restricts access of attributes to only within that class in which it is used.
A public access modifier allows access of attributes by classes outside that class without restriction.
A protected modifier is mostly used in inheritance to extend the access of the attributes to the subclasses of that class in which it is used.
